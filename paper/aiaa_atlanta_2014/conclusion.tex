\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we have presented a comprehensive description, verification and validation of the HiFiLES solver. In its first release, HiFiLES offers to its users an optimal implementation of the Flux Reconstruction methodology in unstructured 3D grids using GPUs or traditional MPI. The code has been tested in some difficult Navier-Stokes and Large Eddy Simulation problems with very satisfactory results.

Despite considerable advances in the accuracy and versatility of subgrid-scale models, current industrial CFD codes are restricted in their ability to perform LES of turbulent flows by the use of highly dissipative second-order numerical schemes.
Therefore, in order to advance the state of the art in industrial CFD, it is necessary to move to high-order accurate numerical methods.
The ESFR family of schemes are ideal for resolving turbulent flows due to low numerical dissipation and high-order accurate representation of solution gradients at the small scales.
Advanced subgrid-scale models have been implemented in HiFiLES for all element types, enabling simulation of turbulent flows over complex geometry.
The development of the first high-order accurate solver for unstructured meshes incorporating LES modeling capabilities represents a significant step towards tackling challenging compressible turbulent flow problems of practical interest.
Future work will include the development of dynamic modeling, non-equilibrium wall modeling and other advanced modeling concepts in order to improve predictions of complex flows on coarse meshes.
