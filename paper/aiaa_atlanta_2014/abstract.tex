\begin{abstract}
The goal of this paper is to show a detailed Verification and Validation of HiFiLES: a high-order Navier-Stokes solver developed at the Aerospace Computing Laboratory (ACL) at Stanford University. HiFiLES has been built on top of SD++ (Castonguay et al.) and achieves high-order spatial discretization with the Energy-Stable Flux Reconstruction (ESFR) scheme in unstructured grids (two and three dimensions). The high parallelizability of this scheme motivates the optimization of the solver's ability to run in a multi-GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) environment.
We intend this paper to be the main reference for HiFiLES and serve as a sort of manual for researchers and engineers that would like to develop or implement high-order numerical schemes based on an Energy-Stable Flux Reconstruction (ESFR) scheme.
%Verification and validation studies performed on the Navier-Stokes (NS) solver HiFiLES are presented. \\HiFiLES achieves high-order spatial discretization with the Energy-Stable Flux Reconstruction (ESFR) scheme in unstructured grids in two and three dimensions. The high parallelizability of this scheme motivates the optimization of the solver's ability to run in a multi-GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) environment with the ability to run in a CPU (Central Processing Unit) cluster. In addition, to exploit such parallelizability, implicit time advancement is realized with dual time-stepping and p-multigrid acceleration. HiFiLES includes a suite of Sub-Grid Scale (SGS) models and filters in order to perform Large Eddy Simulations (LES). To ensure the implementation of the aforementioned features in HiFiLES is correct, the following verification tests were performed: check of spatial and temporal order of accuracy using the Method of Manufactured Solutions in 2D and 3D for viscous and inviscid flows, characterization of stable time-step limits, assessment of computational cost per degree of freedom for a given error tolerance, and measurement of weak and strong scalability in GPUs and CPUs. The simulations of complex flows were validated against experimental or Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) results for the following cases: flow around a circular cylinder, SD7003 wing-section and airfoil at 4$\degr$ angle of attack, DNS of the Taylor-Green Vortex, and DNS and LES of Decaying Homogeneous Turbulence.
