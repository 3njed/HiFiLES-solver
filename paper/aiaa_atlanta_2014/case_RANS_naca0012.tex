\subsection{NACA 0012 airfoil at 0$\degr$ angle of attack, Re = 6 million, Ma = 0.15}
In this section, the NACA 0012 airfoil is used to study the accuracy of the SA turbulence model coupled with FR. The NACA 0012 is commonly used as a validation case for all turbulence models and a large database of results are available at the NASA Turbulence Modeling Resource website. A 6,539 element quad/triangle mixed mesh is used with a NACA 0012 airfoil of chord length 1.0 and a farfield boundary 20 chord lengths away.
