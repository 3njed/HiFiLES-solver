This paper presents a Verification and Validation study of HiFiLES: a high-order LES solver developed at the Aerospace Computing Laboratory (ACL) at Stanford University. HiFiLES has been built on top of SD++ (Castonguay et al.) and achieves high-order spatial discretization with the Energy-Stable Flux Reconstruction (ESFR) scheme in unstructured grids (two and three dimensions). The high parallelizability of this scheme motivates the optimization of the solver's ability to run in a multi-GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) environment.
We intend this paper to be the main reference for HiFiLES and serve (with the previous SD++ papers) as a reference for researchers that would like to develop or implement high-order numerical schemes based on an Energy-Stable Flux Reconstruction (ESFR) scheme.
