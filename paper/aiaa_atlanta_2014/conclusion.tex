\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Despite considerable advances in the accuracy and versatility of subgrid-scale models, current industrial CFD codes are restricted in their ability to perform LES of turbulent flows by the use of highly dissipative second-order numerical schemes.
Therefore, in order to advance the state of the art in industrial CFD, it is necessary to move to high-order accurate numerical methods.
The ESFR family of schemes are ideal for resolving turbulent flows due to low numerical dissipation and high-order accurate representation of solution gradients at the small scales.
Advanced subgrid-scale models have been implemented in HiFiLES for all element types, enabling simulation of turbulent flows over complex geometry.
The development of the first high-order accurate solver for unstructured meshes incorporating LES modeling capabilities represents a significant step towards tackling challenging compressible turbulent flow problems of practical interest.
Future work will include the development of dynamic modeling, non-equilibrium wall modeling and other advanced modeling concepts in order to improve predictions of complex flows on coarse meshes.
