\section{Verification}
\label{sec:verification}
This section describes the check of spatial and temporal order of accuracy using the Method of Manufactured Solutions in 2D and 3D for viscous and inviscid flows, characterization of stable time-step limits, assessment of computational cost per degree of freedom for a given error tolerance, and measurement of weak and strong scalability in GPUs and CPUs.
