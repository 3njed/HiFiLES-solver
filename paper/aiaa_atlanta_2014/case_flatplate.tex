\subsection{Flat Plate}
Computations of the flow over a flat plate have been performed and validated against the results from the high-order workshop. We obtained a $C_{d}$ value of 1.3112e-3 matching with results from the workshop. A detailed description of convergence and error vs. work-units will be presented in the final draft.
